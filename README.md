## Linguist, etc. @UChicago

Hello! My name is Surya Chinnappa. I am an undergraduate at the University of Chicago pursuing a degree in Linguistics and Cognitive Science, researching with APEX Lab in the Department of Psychology. You have found my unfinished website! More updates will follow as there are updates to be made.

Outside of academia, I enjoy music performance and composition, origami, calligraphy, and a host of other things.

Feel free to reach out to me at my email: suryachinnappa@uchicago.edu for any and all inquiries.
